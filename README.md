# QREvents

QREvents will make a QRCode for your guild calendar events.

## Directions

1. Open your in game calendar
2. Select a guild event.
3. Confirm that "<event name> has been saved, and can not be used to create a QRCode." shows up in chat.
4. Create a QRCode with the /qrcode  command.
5. Confirm that "Using captured event data" shows up in chat, and a QRCode is shown.
6. Scan QRCode with your phone, adjust the start time if it is wrong for your timezone.
7. Close the QRCode.

## A note about timezones

To get the best results, log into a character on the same realm as the person creating your guild events.

This will allow the addon to capture the time differences to try to adjust the start time to match your time.

## Notes and thank you

Thank you to the author of qrcode-wow.
This would have taken longer without this addon.
